# RAG
RAG is an architecture that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with external knowledge during inference. Instead of relying solely on the modelâ€™s internal parameters, RAG retrieves relevant information from a vector database and feeds it into the LLM to generate more accurate context-aware responses.
